# OntologyDesignTemplate
Creating ontologies is fun, but how to make sure non-RDF experts understand your thoughts?

This template helps ontology developers to design good-looking ontologies that can be presented to others. 
Simultaneously, it can be used as a logbook for previous versions, Ã¡nd as a place to store ideas or the results of a brainstorm. 
It is meant to be a digital sketchbook that can be used during the entire lifecycle of the ontology. 

The document contains various design elements that can be used to create ontologies and instantiations of ontologies.
